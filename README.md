### Project Description
Weather forecast Android Application with MVVM architecture. The UI will be as like as above screenshot. First time load app requires location permission. If app obtained permission there is a `Spinner` with user current location. Incase the user denied permission app still loads with defalut location and always insisting user to provide access. User can ignore and still see the weather forecast by searching `city name` or `zip code`.

### Open Weather API
I'm using [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/api) for getting weather information. Full documentation for the API is on their site, be sure to take a few minutes to play around.

### Project Setup
Clone the project and open it using Android Studio.
